# branch-updater

> A GitHub App which ensures that your main development branch is up to date.

## Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start

# Run test

```

### Deploy to AWS Lambda

We're using [serverless](https://www.serverless.com/) for the hard work.

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure serverless: You will need AWS credentials in this step
# See: https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/
./node_modules/.bin/serverless config credentials -p aws -k "{{ACCESS_KEY_ID}}" -s "{{SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}}"

# Deploy stack
./node_modules/.bin/serverless deploy
```
